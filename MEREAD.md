# Multipolar Monorepo Project

Welcome to the official repository for our stateful, persistent, and efficient compute plane architecture. This project implements a sophisticated MLOps workflow built on a multi-polar strategy, separating concerns into distinct control, compute, and storage planes.

## Our Commitment to Professional Standards

This repository is engineered to the highest professional standards. Our goal is not just to build functional software, but to create a codebase that is secure, maintainable, auditable, and a pleasure to work on.

All contributors are expected to adhere to the standards and guidelines documented in our canonical **Reference Vault**.

### The Reference Vault: Our Single Source of Truth

Before contributing, please familiarize yourself with the documents in the `/reference` directory. This vault contains the non-negotiable, baseline minimum standards for:

-   **`/reference/Minimum_Professionalism_Standards.md`**: Defines our standards for code quality, documentation, and version control.
-   **`/reference/Minimum_Security_Standards.md`**: Outlines our secure coding practices, based on industry-standard sources like OWASP.
-   **`/reference/AI_Minimum_Operational_Guidelines.md`**: Provides the operational and ethical guidelines for any AI agents or autonomous systems.

### Documentation and Citation Model

We follow a layered, non-redundant documentation model:
1.  **The Reference Vault** contains the foundational standards.
2.  **Inline Comments** in the code provide "train of thought" rationale for *why* a specific implementation choice was made, especially when adapting a standard. We "show our work."
3.  **End-of-File References** cite the specific external articles, libraries, or documentation that informed the code in that file.

This approach ensures our codebase is fully transparent and auditable without unnecessary bloat.

### A Practical Example

To see these standards in action, please review the `SecureSymlinkManager.kt` module located at:
`libs/standards-enforcement/SecureSymlinkManager.kt`

This file serves as a clear, working example of how to apply our security, documentation, and citation standards.
