# AI Minimum Operational Guidelines

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Adopted

## 1. Purpose
This document provides the canonical baseline standards for the design, implementation, and operation of all AI agents and autonomous systems within this repository. The goal is to ensure that all AI components are robust, predictable, auditable, and safe.

## 2. Core Principles
- **Traceability:** Every significant decision or output from an AI agent must be logged and traceable back to its inputs and the specific model version or logic that produced it.
- **Predictability & Determinism:** Whenever possible, AI systems should be designed for deterministic behavior. For stochastic systems, randomness must be seeded and logged to ensure reproducibility.
- **Fail-Safe Design:** AI agents must be designed with clear failure modes. In the event of an unrecoverable error or ambiguity, the agent must halt or escalate to a human operator rather than continuing in an undefined state.
- **Transparency:** The high-level goals and operational boundaries of an AI agent must be clearly documented. It should be possible for an auditor to understand what the agent is designed to do and, just as importantly, what it is designed *not* to do.

## 3. Implementation Standards

### 3.1. Logging and Auditability
- **Decision Logging:** Key decisions, such as selecting an algorithm, modifying a file, or calling an external API, must be logged with a clear rationale.
- **Input/Output Logging:** All inputs received and outputs generated by an agent must be logged. This is critical for debugging and for understanding the agent's behavior over time.

### 3.2. Error Handling
- **Explicit Error States:** Agents must have well-defined error states. Ambiguous or unexpected inputs should trigger a defined error-handling protocol.
- **Circuit Breakers:** For agents that interact with external systems or perform resource-intensive tasks, implement circuit breakers to prevent runaway processes or cascading failures.

### 3.3. Tool Use
- **Scoped Tools:** AI agents must operate with the minimum set of tools and permissions necessary to accomplish their tasks (Principle of Least Privilege).
- **Idempotency:** Tools that modify state should be designed to be idempotent where possible. Running a tool multiple times with the same input should not produce different or harmful results.

### 3.4. Human-in-the-Loop
For any critical or irreversible action (e.g., deploying to production, deleting data), the AI agent must require explicit confirmation from a human operator unless it has been explicitly designed and approved for fully autonomous operation in that context.

*These guidelines ensure that our AI systems are not just capable, but also responsible and trustworthy.*
